## What is a SRFC?

Solana Request for Comments is a proposal for an application standard on Solana. The proposal should document the rationale for the standard and provide enough documentation to understand the implementation

An application standard can be something like the following:

- [Wallet standard api requirements](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-standard)
- Metadata retrieval flow
- Identity standard

A SRFC does not apply to [SIMDs](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/tree/main) or core protocol proposals, but it can propose one if the standard requires a SIMD.

## How do I submit a SRFC?
To get requests for comments on your new application standard on Solana, [submit a new discussion](https://github.com/solana-foundation/sRFCs/discussions/new/choose). You can include links out to further documentation, implementations, or PRs.

## How do I read sRFCs?

You can find all current SRFCs under the [discussion tab](https://github.com/solana-foundation/sRFCs/discussions).

## How will I know if my SRFC gets accepted?
In the current state there is no “acceptance” of SRFCs. They’re requests for comments on potential application standards and it is up to the author to help drive consensus on the standard.
